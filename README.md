I am keen to obtain a junior developer role in a progressive and cutting-edge company, where I can grow and refine my programming skills, whilst also contributing to business growth and development. I am particularly interested in business process improvement through technology application.

I have built up a broad range of experience from project management, solutions implementation and trouble shooting in logistics, to developing client relationships and sales skills at a high level as a Business Development Manager. I am constantly looking to learn and improve my skillset. Having overseen the development and implementation of an ERP system for my previous company, I saw the positive effects such as the efficiencies through automation that software can generate. Looking to work in business process improvement through applying technology, I saw it as being vital to better understand programming and how it pieces together. As a result, I joined Makers Academy, a web developer bootcamp, in October for their full stack web development program.
